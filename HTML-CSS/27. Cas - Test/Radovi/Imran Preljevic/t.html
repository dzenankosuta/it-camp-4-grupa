          He was one of the world's wealthiest person, most powerful and most
          violent criminal.
        </h2>
        <p>
          His name was Pablo Escobar. He became one of the world's biggest drug
          traffickers, the reason why is because as a kid Pablo was always
          driven and had the ambition to raise himself up from his humble
          beginnings. And became this drug trafficker in the 1970’s in Columbia.
          The reason I decided to do my speech on Pablo
        </p>
        <p>
          By the mid-1980’s the Medellin Cartel controlled more than 80 percent
          of the cocaine smuggled into the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than 15 tons of cocaine were reportedly smuggled each day,
          netting the cartel as much as $420 million a week
        </p>
        <p>
          The cartel usually smuggled large amounts by using airplanes and
          dropping the cargo onto a boat near Miami.Which led public opinion
          against him and caused a breakup of the alliance of drug traffickers.
